# Computer-Vision-Exercises
This folder contains a series of Computer Vision Exercises that I have been working on for the past four months, as suggested by Dr. Rubin, to gain greater knowledge of Computer Vision fundamentals from scratch. I already have experience with OpenCV, Keras, Tensorflow, and other machine learning libraries through several AI research endeavors outlined here: https://ankitgupta-research.github.io/.

Organization of Files:
1. Randomly Generate Vertices of a Triangle, along with circumcircle, incircle, and euler line using Bresenham's algorithm
2. Generate 3 random points making sure they are not colinear, then generate a 4th point such that no one point lies in the triangle formed by the other 3 points
3. Read 4 points then create all possible squares that have the 4 points on its side or extensions of its sides
4. Closest Pair of Points using the Brute Force Algorithm
5. Closest Pair of Points using a Preliminary Recursive Algorithm
6. Closest Pair of Points using an Intermediary Recursive Algorithm
7. Closest Pair of Points using the Final Randomized Recursive Algorithm
8. QuickHull Algorithm for finding the smallest Convex hull given a set of 50 randomized points
9. Graham Scan Hull Algorithm for finding the smallest Convex hull given a set of 50 randomized points
10. Canny Edge Detection with the Sobel Operator and a single threshold
11. Complete Canny Edge Detection using non-maximum suppression and hysteresis
12. Canny Edge Detection-Based Coin Detection without OpenCV 
13. Canny Edge Detection-Based Coin Detection with OpenCV
